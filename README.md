**Author:** Andrew Merritt  
**Course:** CSE-302 – Data Structures and Algorithms

**Term:** Fall 2025

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in C++ for **CSE-302 Homework 3**.  

The program allows you to:  
1. **Insert values** into the BST  
2. **Search** for values in the BST  
3. **Print values in sorted order** (in-order traversal)  
4. **Get the height** of the tree  
5. **Rebalance the tree** to ensure minimal height  

The goal of this assignment was to practice:  
- Implementing **BST data structures** in C++  
- Using **recursion** for insertion, search, and traversal  
- Working with **dynamic memory allocation**  
- Balancing a BST to improve efficiency of searches

## 🛠️ Files Included
- **BST.h** – Header file containing the BST class declaration and function prototypes  
- **BST.cpp** – Implementation file for all BST methods, including:
  - Insertion (`PutItem`)  
  - Search (`Search`)  
  - Printing in order (`PrintInOrder`)  
  - Calculating height (`GetHeight`)  
  - Splitting and balancing (`SplitBalance`)  
- **main.cpp** (if included) – Example driver program to test the BST class
